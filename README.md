# iOS-Portfolio

Hello, I'm Martin Zhou, a senior at EPHS. This portfolio showcases my projects I've been working on in my 2020 iOS Mobile App Development class. I've learned about using basic user interface with SwiftUI, 

Much of what I've learned is from tutorials, online courses, and questions on forums. My experience with programming and design includes:
  
* Basic SwiftUI
* Basic Java
* C++
* HTML and CSS
* Python 
* Blender modeling and animation


[War](https://github.com/EPCompSci/portfolio-2020-mrt1nzhou/tree/master/WarGame) is a game I made while following a [Code with Chris](https://codewithchris.com/swiftui/) tutorial.

[Hit the Mole](https://github.com/EPCompSci/portfolio-2020-mrt1nzhou/tree/master/HitTheMoleGame) is deceptively simple, but required me to combine many of the skills I previously learned, such as gesture recognition and data storage.

[Stratagem: Space Conquerers](https://github.com/Stratagem-Studios/Stratagem) a game I developed with Stratagem Studios in which I designed and created the art assets.
