# iOS-Portfolio

Hello, I'm Martin Zhou, a senior at EPHS. This portfolio showcases my projects I've been working on in my 2020 iOS Mobile App Development class. I've learned about using basic user interface with SwiftUI, 

Much of what I've learned is from Apple Tutorials, online courses, and questions on forums. My experience with programming and design includes:

* Basic SwiftUI
* Basic Java
* C++
* HTML and CSS
* Python 

[War](https://github.com/EPCompSci/portfolio-2020-mrt1nzhou/tree/master/WarGame) is a game I made while following a [Code with Chris](https://codewithchris.com/swiftui/) tutorial.

[Hit the Mole](https://github.com/EPCompSci/portfolio-2020-mrt1nzhou/tree/master/HitTheMoleGame) is deceptively simple, as it is probably the application I learned the most while making.

I'm currently working on [an untitled game](https://github.com/Stratagem-Studios/Stratagem) with Stratagem Studios, and have included some of the concept art I have made for it.
