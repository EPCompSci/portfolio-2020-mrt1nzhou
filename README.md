# iOS-Portfolio

Hello, I'm Martin Zhou, a senior at EPHS. This portfolio showcases my projects I've been working on in my 2020 iOS Mobile App Development class. I've learned about using basic user interface with SwiftUI, 

Much of what I've learned is from Apple Tutorials, online courses, and questions on forums. My experience with programming and design includes:

Basic SwiftUI
Basic Java
C++
HTML and CSS
Python
